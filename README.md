Project Pitch: https://www.canva.com/design/DAF5DKildhY/2Q_C4A5_AChgJ6Hi2IjCZA/edit?utm_content=DAF5DKildhY&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton
## Abstract
A robust application to understand the groundwater scenario and its resources of the regions. Representative groundwater level data is analysed using statistical and arithmetical solutions along with the country's groundwater resources to identify the blocks/district/state which has been critical compared to the previous decade.
The application directly addresses the  following responsibilities such as: <br />
• Quantity of the Water Available in that area.<br />
• Quality of the Water with the physical and chemical parameters, which denotes whether the water is capable of drinking or not by colour indications. <br />
• Alarming at the maximum usage of water or wastage of water or leakage of water. <br />
• The Map of the underground water is linked with the spatial maps with the mentioned water specifications and set as an open resource of knowledge to the people about groundwater in the Mobile Application. <br />

## Execution

• **ARIMA Model:** for predicting the future trends. <br />
• **Highchart.Js:** The most powerful visualisation. <br />
• **D3.js:** for maps. Manually making the maps. <br />
• **Vanilla.js:** for the design and interactivity of the website. <br />
• **Genetic Algorithm:** Fully adaptable to new changes in the dataset. <br />

## Proof of Concept

• **State level overview:** A glimpse of state level,comparision with 2013 added. <br />
• **District Level overview:** A national level view of the districts to see a glimpse of the regions that are declining/improving.<br />
• **Block Level:** ARIMA (time series analysis) model ranks the districts and blocks if it is declining or rising.<br />

**UI/UX:** <br />
• Bar charts and line charts have been provided for each block which shows the declining/rising trend to the government so the government can take out the recharge activities in the critical blocks accordingly. The critical  areas have been turned red.<br />
• Number of regions which fall under each status. <br />
• Status Index. <br />
• Full state view with representation by colour with respect to the status. <br />
• Search for displaying the districts. <br />
• Full state view with status and trend conclusion. <br />
• Interactive Graphs. <br />
